Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
This is a Python program that scans web applications for common security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The program sends HTTP requests to the target web application and injects malicious payloads into the input fields to test for vulnerabilities.

Dependencies
This program requires the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
Requests library (for sending HTTP requests)
BeautifulSoup library (for parsing HTML code)

Usage
To use the program, run the scanner.py script and provide the URL of the target web application as a command-line argument:

python scanner.py https://www.example.com/
The program will send HTTP requests to the target web application and inject malicious payloads into the input fields to test for vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities are detected, the program will print a message to the console.

Note: This program is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to attack or exploit real web applications without permission.

Limitations
This program is a simple proof-of-concept and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities in a web application. It also relies on static payloads and may not be effective against custom or obfuscated attack vectors. Therefore, it is recommended to use this program as part of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment process that includes manual testing and other automated scanning tools.
